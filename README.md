# Virtual Tourist
Virtual Tourist is an iOS app that lets you explore the world from the comfort of your couch.

This app is a portfolio project from Udacity's "iOS Persistence and Core Data" course.

Simply drop a pin by tapping and holding at a location of interest.

Tapping a pin downloads interesting Flickr photos that are associated with the latitude and longitude of the location. Photos are displayed as they finish downloading.

Specific photos can be selected for deletion one at a time, or you can grab a new collection altogether.
