Virtual Tourist is an iOS app that lets you explore the world from the comfort of your couch.

Virtual Tourist is a portfolio project from the Udacity "iOS Persistence and Core Data" course.

Simply drop a pin by tapping and holding at a location of interest.

Tapping a pin downloads interesting Flickr photos that are associated with the latitude and longitude of the location. Photos are displayed as they finish downloading.
